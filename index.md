# Abdulla Jasem Almansoori

My name is Abdulla Jasem Almansoori (عبدالله جاسم المنصوري). I started my PhD in machine learning at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence](https://mbzuai.ac.ae) in 2021,
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Martin Takáč](https://mtakac.com) and [Samuel Horváth](https://sites.google.com/view/samuelhorvath).
Previously, I got my master degree in computer science at the University of Southern California in 2018, and before that I got my bachelor in industrial engineering at Purdue University in 2016.

## Research
My interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and optimization. I am generally interested in:
* collaborative learning (e.g., personalization in federated learning).
* deep learning theory and optimization (e.g., overparameterization, adaptive algorithms).
* generative models (GANs, in particular).

My long-term vision is to have a network of intelligent systems that can learn more efficiently and adaptively together and tackle bigger, more complicated real-world problems collaboratively.

## Professional Experience
* I started **national service** 6 months before PhD (Feb 2021) and finished after my first year (June 2022).
I finished **military boot camp** in *Manama Camp, Fujairah*, and then got recruited by *Dubai Police* as a part of the *Expo 2020 batch*. I received airport security training in *Dubai International Airport (DXB)*, worked at *Expo 2020* as a **vehicle inspector** (from dusty trucks to shiny rolls royces), and then worked as a security guard again in *Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC)*.
It had been a great, diverse, mind-opening, humbling experience overall with a slightly hectic shift schedule and long commutes balanced with PhD studies on the side.

* Worked as a **research assistant** in the *Center of Genomics and Systems Biology* at *New York University - Abu Dhabi campus* for about a year before my PhD, where I was sponsored by the Kawader research assistantship. I was part of the core **bioinformatics** team.
I worked on next-generation sequencing pipelines, mostly submitting slurm jobs of AI-based bioinformatics tools.
The team was absolutely great and the work environment was chill (we used to work from home before it was a thing).


## Hobbies
I do enjoy my research, but I also have a lot of other interests. I love cooking (Italian cuisine, in particular). I also love travelling (sometimes for food, e.g., Italy).
Other hobbies include: playing video games (e.g., used to play kaizo-level Mario and ashamedly proud of it), watching anime/reading manga, learning languages (e.g., Japanese and Italian), photography (I have a Fuji X-T10), opening parentheses (like this one), and eating, of course.

<!-- One of the things that helped me start cooking is living abroad alone, and what kept me going is my family. -->
I used to cook rice and chicken (machboos/kabsa) abroad because I wanted to survive and eat homey comfort food.
Sometimes, I would be spending a day or two making lasagne or sourdough bread or whatever, and my whole family would devour the thing within minutes.
There is a beautiful sense of fulfillment that you get when people you care about become happy and complement you for the nice food you make. This gives me the motivation to cook more delicious food that draws a bigger smile on everyone. (I wish my publications have this kind of impact.)


## Contact Me

#### *Note regarding my middle name* (which doubles as an interesting way to fool bots)
It is customary to use the naming format *\[first name + father's name (+ desired number of ancestors) + last name\]* in the arab world because many people share the same *first + last* name (e.g. imagine being called John Smith). We use the shortest length that can sufficiently distinguish us in the given setting. In the US, I would use the standard two-name format (*first + last*) as it is slightly unlikely to see another person sharing the same name abroad at the same institution, for example (though it is still possible). In research, I would use three names (*first + father + last*) because there could be another researcher in marine biology called Abdulla Almansoori, for example. During my national service, however, I had to use four or even five names! You would be surprised at how many times people sharing the same 3-name have been confused for each other (either *first + father + grandfather* or *first + father + last*), especially when the assembly list is sorted alphabetically.
