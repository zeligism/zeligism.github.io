# Abdulla Jasem Almansoori

My name is Abdulla Jasem Almansoori (عبدالله جاسم المنصوري). I started my PhD in machine learning at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence](https://mbzuai.ac.ae) in 2021,
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Martin Takáč](https://mtakac.com) and [Samuel Horváth](https://sites.google.com/view/samuelhorvath).
Previously, I got my master degree in computer science at the University of Southern California in 2018, and before that I got my bachelor in industrial engineering at Purdue University in 2016.

## Research
My interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and optimization. I am generally interested in:
* collaborative learning (e.g., personalization in federated learning).
* deep learning theory and optimization (e.g., overparameterization, adaptive algorithms).
* generative models (GANs, in particular).

My long-term vision is to have a network of intelligent systems that can learn more efficiently and adaptively together and tackle bigger, more complicated real-world problems collaboratively.

## Professional Experience
* **Aug 2025 - Present**: Working as a **research intern in the Adaptive Bayesian Intelligence team at RIKEN-AIP** in Tokyo.

* **May 2025 - Aug 2025**: Joined the **Ads org at Meta** in Sunnyvale as an **intern**. During this internship, I understood many things about how machine learning is done and deployed in practice (hint: data matters). I'm proud that I was able to write code that my team found useful and will build on for future projects, and I was able to train models that will be used in production. Gaining a hands-on ML engineering experience turned out to be more valuable than gaining research experience in hindsight, even from a research perspective. The work culture also gave me a lot of insight on what I'd call "[frictionless](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00865) productivity".

* **Feb 2021 - Jun 2022**: Started **national service** 6 months before PhD and finished after my first year.
I finished **military boot camp**, and then got recruited by *Dubai Police* as a part of the *Expo 2020 batch*. I received airport security training in *Dubai International Airport (DXB)*, worked at *Expo 2020* as a **vehicle inspector** (from dusty trucks to shiny rolls royces), and then worked as a security guard again in *Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC)*.
It had been a great, diverse, mind-opening, humbling experience overall with a slightly hectic shift schedule and long commutes balanced with PhD studies on the side.

* **Jan 2020 - Feb 2021**: Worked as a **research assistant** in the *Center of Genomics and Systems Biology* at *New York University - Abu Dhabi campus* for about a year before my PhD, where I was sponsored by the Kawader research assistantship. I was part of the core **bioinformatics** team.
I worked on next-generation sequencing pipelines, mostly submitting slurm jobs of AI-based bioinformatics tools.
The team was absolutely great and the work environment was chill (we used to work from home before it was a thing).




## Hobbies
I do enjoy my research, but I also have a lot of other interests. I love cooking (especially Italian cuisine). I also love travelling (especially for food).
Other hobbies include: reading, video games (used to play kaizo-level Mario and ashamedly proud of it), anime/manga, learning languages (Japanese and Italian), photography (I have a Fuji X-T10), opening parentheses (like this one), and, of course, eating.

<!-- One of the things that helped me start cooking is living abroad alone, and what kept me going is my family. -->
I used to cook rice and chicken (machboos/kabsa) abroad because I wanted to survive and eat homey comfort food.
Nowadays, sometimes I would be spending a day or two making lasagne or sourdough bread, and my whole family would devour the thing within minutes.


There is a beautiful sense of fulfillment you get when the people you care about become happy because of something you did. This gives me the motivation to cook more delicious food that draws a bigger smile on everyone. (I wish my publications have this kind of impact.)


## Contact Me
You can contact me at **abdu.\[middle name\]@gmail.com**.
#### *Note regarding my middle name* (which doubles as an interesting way to fool bots)
It is customary to use the naming format *\[first name + father's name (+ desired number of ancestors) + last name\]* in the arab world because many people share the same *first + last* name (e.g. imagine being called John Smith). We use the shortest length that can sufficiently distinguish us in the given setting. In the US, I would use the standard two-name format (*first + last*) as it is slightly unlikely to see another person sharing the same name abroad at the same institution, for example (though it is still possible). In research, I would use three names (*first + father + last*) because there could be another researcher in marine biology called Abdulla Almansoori, for example. During my national service, however, I had to use four or even five names! You would be surprised at how many times people sharing the same 3-name have been confused for each other (either *first + father + grandfather* or *first + father + last*), especially when the assembly list is sorted alphabetically.
