# Abdulla Jasem Almansoori

My name is Abdulla Jasem Almansoori (عبدالله جاسم المنصوري). I started my PhD in machine learning at [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence](https://mbzuai.ac.ae) in 2021,
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Martin Takáč](https://mtakac.com) and [Samuel Horváth](https://sites.google.com/view/samuelhorvath).
Previously, I got my master degree in computer science at the University of Southern California in 2018, and before that I got my bachelor in industrial engineering at Purdue University in 2016.

## Research
My interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and optimization. I am generally interested in:
* distributed learning (heterogeneity and personalization in federated learning).
* deep learning theory and optimization (overparameterization, robustness, preconditioning).
* generative models (GAN, VAE, diffusion, LLM, etc).

I firmly believe that a deep understanding of these topics is key towards having *real-world intelligent systems*. My long-term vision is to design a network of intelligent systems that can learn more efficiently together and tackle bigger, more complicated real-world problems collaboratively.


### News
* 2023 Sep: "*Byzantine-Tolerant Methods for Distributed Variational Inequalities*" got accepted to NeurIPS 2023.
* 2023 May: "*Partial Disentanglement with Partially-Federated GANs (PaDPaF)*" got accepted to MLSys 2023 Workshop on Federated Learning Systems.

## Professional Experience
* I started **national service** 6 months before I started my PhD (Feb 2021) and finished right after the end of my first year (June 2022).
I finished **military boot camp** in *Manama Camp, Fujairah*, and got recruited by *Dubai Police* as part of the *Expo 2020 batch*. Received airport security training in *Dubai International Airport (DXB)*, then worked at *Expo 2020* as a **vehicle inspector**, and then worked as a security guard again in *Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC)*.
It had been a great, diverse, mind-opening, humbling experience overall, with a slightly hectic shift schedule and long commutes balanced with PhD studies on the side.

* Worked as a **research assistant** in the *Center of Genomics and Systems Biology* at *New York University - Abu Dhabi campus* for about a year before my PhD, where I was sponsored by the Kawader research assistantship. I was part of the core **bioinformatics** team.
I worked on next-generation sequencing pipelines and deploying AI-based tools on the cluster with slurm (mostly shell and some python).
The team was absolutely great and the work environment was chill and goal-oriented (we used to work from home before it was a thing).


## Hobbies
I have a lot of interests, but so far, I enjoy cooking (particularly love Italian cuisine),
coffee (mostly espresso-based and milk-based), and travelling (I am a big city guy, so my favorites are: New York, Tokyo, Rome, Paris, and of course, Dubai.).
I also enjoy playing video games, watching anime or reading manga, and other stuff like photography and learning languages,
but I'm starting to have less time for those.

One of the things that helped me start cooking is living abroad alone, and what kept me going now is living with my family.
I used to cook rice and chicken (kabsa) abroad because I wanted to survive and eat homey comfort food.
Now, I would spend a day or two making a lasagne from scratch or making sourdough bread or brioche, and my family would devour them within minutes.
This gives me the motivation to cook more delicious stuff. I wish my publications have this kind of impact.

#### *Note regarding my middle name*
It is customary to use the naming format *\[first name + father's name (+ desired number of ancestors) + last name\]* in the arab world because many people share the same *first + last* name (e.g. imagine being called John Smith). We use the shortest length that can sufficiently distinguish us in the given setting. In the US, I would use the standard two-name format (*first + last*) as it is slightly unlikely to see another person sharing the same name abroad at the same institution, for example (though it is still possible). In research, I would use three names (*first + father + last*) because there could be another researcher in marine biology called Abdulla Almansoori, for example. During my national service, however, I had to use four or even five names! You would be surprised at how many times people sharing the same 3-name have been confused for each other (either *first + father + grandfather* or *first + father + last*), especially when the assembly list is sorted alphabetically.
