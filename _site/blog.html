          </h3><p>The idea of a world view in AI is very important. If you want to simulate an autonomous agent that interacts with the world in a non-trivial manner, then we can say that the agent has to maintain a “world-view”.</p>

              A Stupid Analysis of Intelligence
            </a>
          </h3><p>Intelligence is a relative property in the sense that one is more intelligent if: 1) one has “truer expectations” about the world, 2) one converges towards such expectations using a “shorter path”, i.e. with a lesser amount of action or work. The definition can be more meaningful by introducing more dimensions through deconstructing the two properties of intelligence to more layman terms, especially the second property of action. For example, we can compare the intelligence of two agents in a constrained action space (e.g. limited time, resources, etc). What about “truer expectations”? What does it actually mean?</p>

              Free Doom of Speech
            </a>
          </h3><p>Freedom of speech is having the right to voice whatever opinion you have. You feel powerful by voicing any opinion you have (and if you have Twitter, you are invincible and can win any argument). It doesn’t feel fair to have your voice censored. You want to be heard because the other person is heard, so why not you? It is only fair to be equal to that other person, right? We want to believe that we are all the same, have the same rights, and deserve the same treatments. Equality is optimal in some sense. If we assume that people want to have the maximum amount of rights but no less than any other person out there, then equality is the only way to do that. Therefore, we feel like it’s only fair to have the right to voice our opinion as much as the other person.</p>

            </a>
          </h3><p>Memes are just an easily reproducible “signal” that communicates a certain relatable idea or thought. Memes could come in many forms, including words, pictures, videos, gestures, face expressions, or any other signal that we can “get”.</p>

          </h3><p>Scientists possess more scientific knowledge than the average human. It is implied by the job title itself—scientists, those who “do science” for a living. But science is the thing that contains all known logical knowledge about the universe. Hence, scientists often think that they know more about how the world works, which is kinda true. They also tend to be more logically consistent by the very facts that they are doing science and that science must be logically consistent because without logical consistency, one might as well claim anything one wants.</p>

              Deep Success
            </a>
          </h3><p>The most troubling trend in with the way of life of some of the most successful people is that they optimize their lives for success (<em>duh</em>), but success itself is a quality that is measured by some standards other <strong>people</strong> set. You can’t simply claim that you are successful because you see yourself so. It can definitely happen, but it’s gonna be pathetic and sad as we all know. You have to make people decide whether you are successful or not. So being successful does not make sense without relying on people’s opinions. Whose opinion you rely on is something that only you can decide.</p>

              Concisenessityhood
            </a>
          </h3><p>To be concise is to say (almost) the same thing with less words. There are so many reasons why it’s so great. People don’t want to hear you talking all day, for starters. Also, conciseness has some beauty to it. We can relate more to a meaning that is conveyed through shorter sentences than longer ones.</p>

Killers take away lives, so one could say that by killing someone, they are stealing something invaluable or priceless from them. What is the right justice to serve in this case? To be just and completely fair, we have to take something invaluable from them in return.</p>
