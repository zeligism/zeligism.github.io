  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>My name is Abdulla Jasem Almansoori, a PhD student in machine learning at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae">Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence</a>,
where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://mtakac.com">Martin Takáč</a>. Previously, I was a master student in computer science at the University of Southern California, and before that I was studying for a bachelor in industrial engineering at Purdue University.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>My interests span multiple areas, but they often lie at the intersection of machine learning and optimization. For example, I am generally interested in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>deep learning theory and optimization (NTK, double-descent, overparameterization, implicit DL, robustness),</li>
  <li>deep generative models (GANs, VAEs, duality), and</li>
  <li>distributed learning (federated learning, non-IID, model averaging / knowledge distillation, communication).</li>
</ul>

<p>I firmly believe that a deep understanding of these topics and their intersection is key towards having <em>real-world intelligent systems</em>. My long-term vision is to design a network of intelligent systems that can learn more efficiently together and tackle bigger, more complicated problems collaboratively.</p>

<h2 id="professional-experience">Professional Experience</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I started <strong>national service</strong> 6 months before I started my PhD (Feb 2021) and finished right after the end of my first year (June 2022).
I finished <strong>boot camp</strong> with the military in <em>Manama Camp</em> (near Fujairah), and luckily got recruited by <em>Dubai Police</em> as part of the <em>Expo 2020 batch</em>. Got some security training (baggage inspection) in <em>Dubai International Airport (DXB)</em>, worked at <em>Expo 2020</em> as a <strong>vehicle inspector</strong>, and then went to <em>Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC)</em> as a security guard again.
It had been a great, diverse, mind-opening, humbling experience overall, with a slightly hectic shift schedule and long commutes balanced with PhD studies on the side.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Worked as a <strong>research assistant</strong> in the <em>Center of Genomics and Systems Biology</em> (led by Kris Gunsalus and Fabio Piano) at <em>New York University - Abu Dhabi campus</em> for one year and a few months before my PhD, where I was sponsored by the Kawader research assistantship.
I was part of the core <strong>bioinformatics</strong> team (led by Nizar Drou).
I learned a lot working on next-generation sequencing pipelines and deploying AI-based tools on the cluster with slurm and whatnot (mostly shell and some python).
The team was absolutely great and the work environment was chill and goal-oriented (we used to work from home before it was a thing).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
<p>I have a lot hobbies, unfortunately.
I will never have the time to master one, but so far cooking (and coffee) has been my main interest because I love food (and coffee).</p>

<p>One of the things that helped me start cooking is living abroad alone, and what kept me going now is living with my family.
I used to cook machbous abroad because I wanted to survive and eat homey comfort food.
Now, I would go and bake a two loaves of brioche (or sourdough bread),
and my family would devour the first loaf before the second one even comes out of the oven (say ما شاء الله).
This gives me the motivation to cook more delicious stuff.
One of the things that inspired me to cook is eating good food, from street food to michelin-starred.
I’m still growing in this area slowly (because it breaks the bank quickly).</p>

<p>Other hobbies include learning languages (time-consuming, but can be extremely interesting), watching anime (fun, helps with learning Japanese), playing video games (my childhood-productivity killer, but I still love it), travelling (standby tickets ftw), street photography (especially during my travels), reading (not books), writing (stuff like this with lots of parentheses), and hanging out with the family and friends (the good old stuff).</p>

<h2 id="contact-me">Contact Me</h2>
<p>You can contact me at abdu.[middle name]@gmail.com.</p>
<h4 id="note-regarding-my-middle-name"><em>Note regarding my middle name</em></h4>
<p>It is customary to use the naming format <em>[first name + father’s name (+ desired number of ancestors) + last name]</em> in the arab world because many people share the same <em>first + last</em> name (e.g. imagine being called John Smith). We use the shortest length that can sufficiently distinguish us in the given setting. In the US, I would use two names (<em>first + last</em> name) as it is slightly unlikely to see another person sharing the same name abroad at the same institution, for example, but it is still possible. In research, I would use three names (<em>first + father + last</em>) because there could be another researcher in marine biology called Abdulla Almansoori, for example. During my national service, however, I had to use four or even five names! You would be surprised at how many times people sharing the same 3-length names have been confused for each other (either <em>first + father + grandfather</em> or <em>first + father + last</em>), especially when the assembly list is sorted alphabetically.</p>

<p>Another reason I use my father’s name is because I like it.</p>
