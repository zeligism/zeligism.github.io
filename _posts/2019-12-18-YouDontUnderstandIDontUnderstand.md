This is a pedagogical analysis of not-understanding.

Teachers often ask students things like this: “Did you understand?”, “Do you have any questions?”, or “Who can answer this question?”, and so on. The problem with this kind of questions is that the teacher is giving the student control over the lecture, and quite often the students are very bad at making the lecture interesting or useful, unless the audience is a small number of extremely interested and cooperative students, like in some graduate courses.

Depending on the students, the assumed goal of every lecture is well-known; to successfully communicate novel ideas. However, sometimes, the students’ goal is to finish the lecture as soon as possible, disregarding how much they actually understood (i.e. how much of the ideas were communicated successfully). This is typical due to a lot of reasons, many of which can be attributed to having different priorities that make one pay less attention to the lecture. For example, if the student was playing a video game and have been fighting a tough boss for a long time and not winning, the student might sit during the lecture brainstorming new strategies to beat this tough boss, in addition to---unsuccessfully, of course---trying to understand the material of the lecture. This is the first point to keep in mind: students may be present, but their minds may be stuck somewhere else. They should be in the context of the lecture and paying good attention to be able to understand.

Now the second point is about the “understanding” part. When a student says “Yes, I understand”, they probably don’t understand in *your* sense, they understand in *their* (probably naive) sense. They might have understood the subject to the extent that enables them to barely pass the next exam, which is a really bad measure of understanding. A key measure of understanding some concept is the ability to explain it (the Feynman definition of understanding). This is a really good measure to test not only the students’s understanding but your own understanding as well. Of course, since you’re the teacher, you‘d better understand the topic you’re explaining. Now, instead of asking “Do you understand?”, you can ask “Can you explain it?”

The final point is related to the second in that you try to get into the students’ heads and teach them from there. Don’t let them decide whether things are going well based on their own ways. Whenever you ask a question, ask it not in the sense that you are proof-checking their answers and trying to beat them into failure, but in the sense that you want them to *voluntarily* contribute their answers to the lecture. For example, the students might not have any follow-up question, in which case you can stir up their internal reasoning until an apparent contradiction or a missing piece of the puzzle prompts the students to ask interesting questions, and thus remember the concept from the memory of this internal conflict, so to speak. Questions are a good way to test student’s understanding as well, especially open-ended ones. Let them ask interesting questions and let them find the answers themselves by guiding them only when necessary. Do it from their perspectives, not yours.

Once you prepare the students to be able to understand, communicate, apply, and expand on an idea, they will thus be able accelerate the progress of science and spread of knowledge further down the road in their careers.
