*[Warning: bad jokes ahead!]*

**Wife**: I've had enough of your obsession over math! You never spend time with me. I'm leaving.

**Mathematician**: Honey, please, I beg you… don’t leave me alone! I love you!

**Wife**: Then prove it to me!

**Mathematician**: Let ε > 0. There exists δ > 0 such tha–

**Wife**: OMG JUST FORGET IT.

A mathematician was hanging out in the neighborhood of a closed subspace. He fell off.

Meanwhile, another mathematician was walking continously through an open neighborhood. He is still walking.

A logician once tried to tell a funny joke. He failed and concluded that his “funny joke is not funny.” He died in an infinite self-recursion.

**Logician 1**: I’m not who I used to be.

**Logician 2**: Then you say you are not who you were?

**Logician 1**: Yes, that is correct.

**Logician 2**: Then when were you you? Or when will you be you?

**Logician 1**: Well, I am me, at least at the very moment I said it.

**Logician 2**: But if whom you described as you is not you before nor now at this very moment, then you can never be exactly you because there are infinitely many moments where the you who you said is not you were in fact you or will be you, so you are not you.

**Logician 1**: Fuck.

Two successful businessmen mathematicians had a shady business based on duplication of money on demand. They were once asked whether they were Nigerian king magicians or something. They said “Nah, we’re just Banach and Tarski.”

**Computer scientis**t: What do you want for dinner?

**Machine learning scientist**: I don’t care. Let’s just sample from a distribution.

~

A statistician walks into a bar with two standard deviations. He says, “I’ll have the usual, but make it with a 95% confidence interval. Last time was a little too risky.”

~

A topologist walks into a coffee shop and orders a donut. The barista hands them a mug.

**Topologist**: “Perfect.”

~

A logician walks into a bar and orders a drink.

**Bartender**: What will you have?

**Logician**: I’ll have a Gödel number of the self-referential drink that says, ‘I cannot be served.’”

**Bartender**: I’m not even sure if that’s on the menu, but I feel paradoxically compelled to serve it to you anyway.

~

A quantum physicist was at a casino.

**Dealer**: Sir, are you going to place your bet?

**Quantum Physicist**: I already did.

**Dealer**: Where?

**Quantum Physicist**: In an alternate universe. I’m just waiting for the wave function to collapse.
