*[Warning: bad jokes ahead!]*

Mathematician: Honey, please, I beg you… don’t leave me alone! I love you!

Wife: Then prove it to me!

Mathematician: Sure. Let ε > 0. There exists δ > 0 such tha–

Wife: OMG JUST FORGET IT.

A mathematician was hanging out in the neighborhood of a closed subspace. He fell off.

Meanwhile, another mathematician was walking continously through an open neighborhood. He is still walking.

Mathematician 1: I’m not what I used to be.

Mathematician 2: Then you say you are not who you were?

Mathematician 1: Yes, that is correct.

Mathematician 2: Then when were you you? Or when will you be you?

Mathematician 1: Well, I am me, at least at the very moment I said it.

Mathematician 2: But if whom you said is you isn’t you now nor before, then you can never be exactly you because there are infinitely many moments where the you who said is not you were in fact you or will be you, so you are not you.

Mathematician 1: Fuck.

A logician once tried to tell a funny joke. He failed and concluded that his “funny joke is not funny.” He died in an infinite self-recursion.

Two successful businessmen mathematicians had a shady business based on duplication of money on demand. They were once asked whether they were Nigerian king magicians or something. They said “Nah, we’re just Banach and Tarski.”

What does a string theorist cowboy say when he rides his horse?

“Calabi-Yeeeehau!”

*α-mathematicians at the bar*

Real Analyst: I like my women real smooth.

Group theorist: I like my women normal.

Ring theorist: Screw normal, I like my women ideal.

Algebraist: I like my women isomorphic to my wife.

Logician: I like my women iff my wife.

Geometrist: I like a cute woman.

Linear algebraist: You a fine girl.

Combinatorialist: I like to count 'em.

Differential geometrist: I like them curves.

Elliptical geometrist: Dude got some non-Euclidean balls.

Statistician: I like my women average and in large numbers.

Probability theorist: I like my women almost everywhere.

Functional Analyst: I like her on the specturm.

Optimization scientist: If her lips shits, I’ll smash.

Theoretical physicist: Well, I like my women symmetric.

Cosmologist: As for me, I like “black holes”.

Topologist: The more holes, the better.

Theoretical computer scientist 2: I like my women hard. NP-hard.

Deep learning engineer: I like it deep and fast.

Machine learning engineer: But you should stop early. Gotta minimize the risks.

Machine learning scientist: Bayes'ed woman.

Computational learning theorist: I like my women probably approximately hot.

Random matrix theorist: OMG you guys are like soooo randooom.
