Life is *invaluable*, right? So, one could say that, by killing someone, killers are stealing something *invaluable* or *priceless*. What is the right justice to serve in this case? To be just and completely fair, do we have to take something *invaluable* from them in return?

Some think that this invaluable thing should be their lives as well, so they take it away from them (capital punishment). Others think that their lives could be taken away temporarily by putting the killers in a small isolated word (prison). How do you choose correctly what to take from killers in return for what they took from their victims, which is their *invaluable* lives?

The problem is that life cannot be returned to the victim, nor any other thing of the same value can be returned to the victim’s family (unless everybody agree in their beliefs of the afterlife). However, saying that life is **literally invaluable** would allow the victims to claim that they can be compensated with whatever they ask for. Saying that life is invaluable is the same as saying that the value of life is infinite, so the value of what the victims can ask for in return could be anything, or perhaps a "comparable infinite" (looking at you, Cantor). In order to understand how to be completely just in compensating the victims for the loss of life, we have to sit down and admit that life does have a value; a finite value, that is.

The value of life is a subjective thing. The value of one’s own life may, indeed, be relatively infinite as it could be more important to oneself than anything else. But that isn’t always the case. If it was, then nobody would sacrifice their lives for any reason. The value of other people’s lives is also subjective in a similar fashion. Also, the victim is dead, so the closest people to the victim are the ones who will demand compensation, but the compensation would then depend on those people's valuation of the life of the victim, which is often lessr than the victim's valuation of his life.

In addition to that, life does not have the same value at every moment. some people value their lives much more than others. Some moments in life are extremely filled with joy and activity, and others are just dull. But everybody is going to die sooner or later, so unless your life has moments which have an infinite value, your total life must have a finite value since its duration is finite (unless you’re immortal, of course). So to summarize, **the value of life is really subjective and dynamic**.

Now consider this: suppose that criminal A (old, male) raped and killed a young woman who has a high potential to do great things for society and is enjoying her life to the fullest. Next, suppose that criminal B (young, female) raped and killed an old fart who is a worthless neglected piece of shit that did absolutely nothing for society, or, even worse, did extremely bad things to society. Then, should we REALLY treat criminals A and B equally, given that they commited the same crime? Should we serve them the same justice (e.g. same number of years in prison)?
What if criminal A killed the young woman by accident and the rape was just a false accusation? What if the same happened for criminal B?
Think about the above scenario very carefully. If you were to be presented with these two cases on different occasions and contexts, I bet you would be thinking “Criminal A should be tortured and have his dick stuck up his own ass for eternity” and maybe “Criminal B should be served justice for what she did, but I feel like we should investigate this a little more because something weird is going on.”
Not only is the value of life subjective, it is **contextual**.
The narrative and the situation play a role in the subjectivity.

Justice is about achieving a **good balance between fairness and regulation**. Fairness is achieved by compensation to victims and regulation is achieved by punishment to wrongdoers (e.g., to prevent more future wrongdoings). More generally, justice can be seen as trying to achieve a robust **equilibrium of people's utilities, including future/expected utilities**.
Thus, in this sense, universal justice should take into account everybody's valuation of everybody's lives simulataneously. The fair valuation of life should achieve the most stable utilities. Theoretically speaking, this is all good, but there remains the challenge of **measuring** utility, which manifests as the subjectivity of people's valuation of life.

We do have a standardized notion of utility (income, value of assets, health benefits, family, job, education, etc). However, this always come at the cost of being **unfair to those at tail of the distribution** on which this **standardized** notion of utility is inaccurate. These people should greatly benefit from a case-by-case, personalized decision making system.

This leads to the conclusion that a valuation of life is meaningless without context. Also, you can't measure the value of life meaningfully and without offending someone (i.e., at the other end of the tail). It is why we have judicial systems as part of the government because they serve as a foundation for the country's beliefs in what is just and fair. This might seem quite obvious, but it's deeper than I thought.
