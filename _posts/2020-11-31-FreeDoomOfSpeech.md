Freedom of speech is the right to speak your opinion. You feel empowered when you voice your opinion (and if you have Twitter, you are invincible and can win any argument). It doesn’t feel fair to have your voice censored. You want to be heard because the other person is heard, so why not you? It is only fair to be equal to that other person, right? We want to believe that we are all the same, have the same rights, and deserve the same treatments. If people want to have the maximum amount of privileges but no less than the other person, then equality is the only way to do that.

Free doom of speech is what follows precisely when evil desires manifest. Humans are constantly looking for opportunities to gain an advantage. It is an instinct from the ancient times. They want to hunt better than you to get that sweet T-Rex fillet mignon. They want to be more powerful than you to get stuff from you and then settle in your land and steal resources and live in your house and then, you know, maybe do some naughty stuff because why not. They also want to get more money than you because they want more stuff than you because you’re ugly and stupid. Call it what you want, but humans are competing for an advantage in every waking moment, and things have gotten ugly throughout history.

Today, humans have achieved a mature understanding of moral values that “make sense”. These moral values help humans make fair decisions in their everyday lives. We have come to understand the “evils” that we should avoid, even though they might come with an advantage. Have you ever *stolen* a piece of candy as a little kid? You might have, and you are not to blame. You still didn’t understand morality very well. You would have thought that gaining such an (unfair) advantage, i.e. not having to pay for candy while others have to pay, is an opportunity that you should seize. But this is not sustainable; gaining such an advantage for yourself will cause a disadvantage for others. This is why morality is good. It is there to *regulate* our behavior and interactions with society and maintain *stability*.

Maybe you're thinking "How does this have anything to do with freedom of speech?" Well, the connection is subtle, but it shows the "doom" of this *uncensored and unregulated* kind of "free" speech (as in not-paying-for-candy free). It is funny that we have made a full circle and we're back to point zero when it comes to moral values. The evil created within society by the lack of morality will eventually create opportunities of abuse. Paradoxically, people can use freedom of speech itself to gain an unfair advantage by claiming its freedom and stripping it away from others! For example, with the power of freedom of speech, anyone can say this to anyone:

*"Thanks to freedom of speech, it is my right to say what I feel. Therefore, fuck you. You are such a stupid racist xenophobic bigot cunt that should die. No, you should actually slowly rot in hell alone while crying bloody streams of misery. No wait, scratch that. You should slowly rot to death in a muddy hole in the middle of a burning black forest while the hounds of hell devour your guts like it's their birthday, and while an elephants is ramming you non-stop and the whole world is watching on a giant IMAX screen and laughing at you. You should be hated forever. Sure, the devil might be jealous of my spiteful unholiness and rotten morals, but I have like 24k retweets and 167k likes on my previous post, so I am invincible."*

Have we really forgot that fairness and equality of rights is what lies at the heart of freedom of speech? How come those who use their speech to cancel others are still feeling completely fair about it? What happened to constructive discourse? Humans became advanced as a civilization because they function as societies and not as individuals, so getting rid of morality seems like going back to the ancient mindset of the stone ages when war was waged over the most trifiling stuff. At least that is how it feels like in Twitter.
