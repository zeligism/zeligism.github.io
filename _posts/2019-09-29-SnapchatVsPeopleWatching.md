JOHN:
(*opens up Snapchat, watches people living their lives*)...

TOM:
(*sighs*).

JOHN:
(*swiping*)...
(*watches a snap, smiles faintly*).

TOM:
I don’t understand what’s the joy in watching other people’s lives, having fun and doing stupid shit. People these days are so weird.

JOHN:
I don’t know, it’s kinda fun. Did you see this guy, though? He’s funny. He does stupid shit.

TOM:
No thanks. I think you're the one who's stupid.

JONATHON: (*sits outdoor in his favorite cafe, watches people living their lives*)...

THOMAS: (*sighs*).

JONATHON:
(*screening*)...
(*eyes a mesmerizing lady, coughs gently*). Ahem, **M’lady**. (*tips hat*).

THOMAS: 'T bewild'rs me yond a sir finds pleasure in the trifling act of obs'rving the commonplace existence of the populace, amusing themselves and whatnot.

JONATHON: 'tis the passing of timeth and m'rry moments, mine own cousin.  Beholdeth this ingraft'r, f'r that gent hast wits!

THOMAS: Much obliges, alas methinks thy joyous endeav'rs is but f'r the foolish, unscrupulous men.
