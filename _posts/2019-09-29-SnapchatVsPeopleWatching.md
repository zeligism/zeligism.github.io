JOHN:
(*opens up Snapchat, watches people living their lives*)...

TOM:
(*sighs*).

JOHN:
(*swiping*)... (*looks at a hot girl and sends a heart emoji*)

TOM:
I don’t understand what’s the joy in watching other people’s lives, having fun and whatever.

JOHN:
It’s just for passing time and it's kinda fun! Did you see this guy, though? He’s really funny!

TOM:
No, thanks, but I think you're wasting precious time that could be used in doing other productive stuff.

JONATHON: (*sits outdoor in his favorite cafe, watches people living their lives*)...

THOMAS: (*sighs*).

JONATHON:
(*screening*)...
(*eyes a mesmerizing lady, coughs gently, and tips hat*). Ahem, **M’lady**.

THOMAS: 'T bewild'rs me yond a sir finds pleasure in the trifling act of obs'rving the commonplace existence of the populace, amusing themselves and whatnot.

JONATHON: 'tis the passing of timeth and m'rry moments, mine own cousin! Beholdeth this ingraft'r, f'r that gent hast wits!

THOMAS: Much obliges, alas methinks thy joyous endeav'rs is but f'r the unscrupulous men.
