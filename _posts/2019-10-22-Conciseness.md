To be concise is to say (almost) the same thing with less words. There are so many reasons why it’s so great. People don’t want to hear you talking all day, for starters. Also, conciseness has some beauty to it. We can relate more to a meaning that is conveyed through shorter sentences than longer ones.

But why does conciseness have this quality of being *inherently good*? I thought about this for a while, and I concluded that the reason for this is the following: since conciseness means *approximately* the same meaning in less words, then being concise means achieving *approximately* similar results with less energy overall, either from the speaker or the listener (i.e. energy for attention, processing, etc). The amount of energy people are willing to spend is situational, though. For example, we like to spend more energy with people we love, so if you've noticed, we are usually less concise (i.e. more verbose) with our most beloved.

The key word in the last paragraph is *approximately*. Of course, we can’t achieve the exact same meaning with less words. If we are only talking about information using **bits** (0 and 1), then we can be perfectly concise at transmitting the bits, which means that we can eventually achieve the theoretical minimum amount of bits possible to represent a piece of information. This is because we have a precise mechanism for information retrieval (i.e. deterministic decompression algorithms). Notice that we assumed that the listener knows about this optimal decompression algorithm, which might not be the case. That is why extremely concise arguments with a stupid person can be ineffective. You have to be verbose enough so that the listener can perfectly decode what you say with high probability.

Also, compression of **words**, as in compressing their *meanings* somehow, is an ill-defined process for the very reason that the choice of a word itself---irrespective of its given meaning in the dictionary---directly impacts the meaning it wants to convey based on each of our own unique associative experiences. Otherwise, summaries would be just called *compression schemes*. People summarize differently because achieving conciseness is an ambiguous goal. Conciseness is subjective because the more empirical evidence you have of what a good concise writing constitutes of, the more acclaimed and well-regarded (i.e. better) your summaries will be. Of course, ambiguities are undesirable, but you know what they say: ***conciseness is sexy***.
