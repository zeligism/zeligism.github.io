Yes. It can.

Just wanted to let you know that there exists coffee that literally tastes like melon.
It's incredible.
The coffee is from Milan farm in Colombia, roasted by Glitch Roasters in Tokyo.
[Check it out here](https://shop.glitchcoffee.com/en/products/restock-colombia-risaralda-milan-nitro-wash).
The roasters say in the link:
> This coffee is characterized by a variety of fruity flavors that will overturn your concept of coffee. It is reminiscent of a fruit basket, and comes in a variety of flavours, including melon, guava, strawberry and watermelon, and can be enjoyed as the temperature and aging process changes."

As pretentious as it may sound to you, they're actually right.
I'm already into coffee and know that great flavorful coffee beans exist, but I didn't know that a melon-juice level of coffee exists.
They only sell it in 100g bags and it costs Â¥4,200 per bag (for god's sake).
If that sounds "whopping" to you, then check their competition coffee beans out.
Their Ginza branch is crazy busy, but their Osaka branch is much more spacious and cozy and way less busy (and the coffee is as incredible).

You reached this far.
Seems like you you're interested in coffee.
Might as well tell you about coffee beans that taste like blackberry-flavored chocolate ganache.
This one is from Mamuto, Kenya, roasted by George Howell.

Another roaster that sources great Kenyan coffee beans is a Taiwanese roaster called KakaLove.

Would love to visit these two roasters in person one day.

Finally, I need to mention this one.
I'm not exactly sure what kind of sorcery they use to roast their coffee beans, but it's so unique, I've never tasted anything like it before.
The roaster is called [Torahebi](https://www.torahebi.jp), and they are hidden in the 3rd floor of Parco in Shibuya.
They are mysterious; the origin of the coffee beans and the roasting process are unknown, and they claim that the roasting process is innovative and was invented by their head roaster who used to be a chemist.
Ok, that makes sense, but if chemistry can make my coffee taste literally like bananas without putting bananas in, then I'll have to be flabbergasted nonetheless.
The coffee beans themselves look oily and dark, but the fragrance is insane.
The flavor notes are equally as pronounced, to the point you will feel like the roaster had cheated somehow because it's impossible for coffee to taste like this!
They also have a strawberry blend and the taste of a flat white made with it is remniscent of strawberry milk.
Another interesting blend they have is the aged sake blend, which they claim does not contain a hint of alcohol.
Anyways, if you're in Shibuya and love coffee, then this one is a no-brainer.
