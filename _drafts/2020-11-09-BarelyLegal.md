For all $$\epsilon > 0$$, suppose that the following happens:

$$18+\epsilon$$ year-old guy: "hi ur very attrektive can u be my gf?"

$$18-\epsilon$$ year-old girl: "Ewww, creep! Get away from me you pedo!"

For infinitely small $$\epsilon$$, you can see the absurdity of this rejection, as the age difference would be $$2 \epsilon$$, and as you might already know, you can find $$\delta < 2\epsilon$$, where $$\delta$$ is... you know.

Anyways, creeping out from an arbitrary threshold set heuristically by the law is in itself absurd, as the lawâ€™s primary intent is to encourage moral behavior, order, and justice. This is a classical case of overfitting to the law. We are overfitting to the model of morality and justice, so we need a regularizer of some kind. We need to tax these mf pedos!
